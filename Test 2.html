       Deforestation is the complete removal of a forest ecosystem and conversion of the land to another type of landscape. It differs from clear cutting, which entails complete removal of all standing trees but leaves the soil in a condition to regrow a new forest if seeds are available.
   <br>
        Humans destroy forests for many reasons. American Indians burned forests to convert them to grasslands that supported big game animals. Early settlers cut and burned forests to convert them to croplands. Between 1600 and 1909, European settlement decreased forest cover in the United States by 30 percent. Since that time, total forest acreage in the United States actually has increased. In Germany, about two-thirds of the forest was lost through settlement.
        <br>
        According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally. Most forest loss occurs in the world's tropical regions. The U.N. estimates that global agriculture will need to sustain a population of nine billion people by 2050, but with only modest increases in arable land because 80 percent of arable lands are already in use.
