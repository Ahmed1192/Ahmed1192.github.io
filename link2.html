        <p>Help save our great global forests. Our forests are precious beyond imagination. We must protect them for the people living in them and people everywhere. Forests regulate the climate and host an extraordinary array of plants and animals. But to a greedy few, forests are just land, waiting to become pastures, plantations, or roads; sources of timber, rubber, or minerals for profit. Together we can be forest defenders and work towards their restoration for the benefit of all life on earth.
